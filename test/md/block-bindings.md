## Feature

1. Synced Hero Pattern for Posts with the following parts editable:
   a. Cover background image
   b. Author name (which can include their position too) via a custom field, with the default name being the post author.

# Steps

1. Bind the block to the source, such as a custom field (aka post-meta) such as:

```html
<!-- wp:paragraph {
  "metadata":{
    "bindings":{
      "content":{
        "source":"core/post-meta",
        "args":{
          "key":"book-genre"
        }
      }
    }
  }
} -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
```

2. Register the post-meta via functions.php

```php
function theme_slug_register_meta() {
  register_meta(
      'post',
      'book-genre',
      array(
          'show_in_rest' => true,
          'single'       => true,
          'type'         => 'string',
          'default'      => 'Default text field',
      )
  );
}
add_action( 'init', 'theme_slug_register_meta' );
```

## NOTES

- Block bindings can use custom fields (core/post-meta), pattern overrides (core/pattern-overrides), and more.
- when using custom fields, content can be unique in different pages, but will be the same on the same page.
